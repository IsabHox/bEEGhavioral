    "In this workshop, we have seen a technique that combines behavioral and neural recordings quite elegantly. In reality, there are additional steps that would be necessary to conclude on the link between phase and response times. Indeed, since both the phase and the response time can have an impact on the differences that we see, there should be a way to counteract individual effects to keep only combined effects. This is done through permutations: we shuffle the matching between phases and response times, recompute the wITPC, repeat this process several times and average the maps thus obtained to create the \"null hypothesis\", that is, create what maps would look like if the mapping between phase and response times were random.\n",
